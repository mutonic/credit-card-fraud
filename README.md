# Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine Learning
This is a Capstone Project that aims to detect credit card fraud using Machine Learning techniques. The goal of this project is to develop a model that can accurately identify fraudulent transactions.

## Data Cleaning
The first step in this project was to clean the data. This involved handling missing values, removing unnecessary features, and dealing with outliers.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
After cleaning the data, an exploratory data analysis was performed. This included univariate analysis, bivariate analysis, and multivariate analysis. The aim of this step was to gain insights into the distribution of the data, and to identify patterns or relationships that could be useful in building a predictive model.

## Model Preparation
In order to prepare the data for modeling, it was necessary to perform a resampling using the SMOTE technique. This helped to balance the dataset and ensure that the model was not biased towards the majority class.

## Model Building
Different machine learning models were built, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting Models. The models were trained and tested on the dataset, and the results were compared.

## Results
The results showed that the Random Forest model performed the best, with an accuracy of 94.2%. This model was able to accurately identify fraudulent transactions, and it is the recommended model for detecting credit card fraud.

## Usage
You can use this project as a reference for your own credit card fraud detection project. Data is available on kaggle, you can download it and use it in your google colab python code.

## Note
Please note that data used in this project is only for educational purpose and not to be used in production or commercial use.
